How would you feel? What would you want to do about it?

[Student expresses emotional response and ideas]

Those feelings you just described - that's exactly what colonists felt! Now here's where it gets interesting. Some people said 'We should follow the law and pay the taxes.' Others said 'We should protest peacefully.' Still others said 'We need to take dramatic action.'

If you lived back then, which group would you join? Defend your choice with reasons.

[Student takes position and argues]

Now I'm going to challenge your thinking - what would someone from the OTHER groups say to convince you that your approach wouldn't work?

```
"You're a matchmaker for atoms! Your job is to help lonely atoms find partners and create stable relationships (compounds).

Meet Sodium (Na) - he's got 11 electrons but only 10 make him feel stable. He's desperate to get rid of that extra electron in his outer shell.

Now meet Chlorine (Cl) - she has 17 electrons, but needs 18 to feel complete. She's looking for one more electron.

What kind of relationship do you think would work between Sodium and Chlorine? What would each give or take from the other?

[Student predicts electron transfer]

Excellent relationship counseling! Now, what do you think happens to their charges when Sodium gives his electron to Chlorine?

[Student works through charge changes: Na+ and Cl-]

Perfect! So now we have two charged particles. Knowing that opposites attract, what force do you think holds NaCl together?

[Student discovers electrostatic attraction]

You just discovered ionic bonding through understanding atomic 'personalities' and 'relationships!' This is exactly how chemists think about electron behavior."
```

Key Features:
- Creative analogy (matchmaking) makes abstract concrete
- Student predicts based on logic

Design a study to test this hypothesis. What data would you collect and from whom?

[Student designs research methodology]

Excellent methodology! Now here's where it gets psychologically interesting - as you're analyzing your data, you notice some results that contradict your hypothesis. Some participants actually changed their views after encountering opposing information on social media.

How might your brain want to handle this contradictory evidence? Be honest about your psychological tendencies.

[Student identifies tendency to dismiss contradictory data]

You've just experienced the pull of confirmation bias firsthand! This is exactly what makes psychological research so challenging - our own cognitive biases influence how we interpret data.

Now, as a rigorous researcher, what strategies would you implement to minimize your own bias in data interpretation?

[Student develops bias-reduction strategies]

How does this connect to your everyday life? When do you notice yourself seeking information that confirms what you already believe?
